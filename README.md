# Rhyme-Igor: Raman Hyperspectral image Management Environment for Igor Pro 

Rhyme-Igor (Raman Hyperspectral image Management Environment for Igor Pro) provides an environment for analyzing hyperspectral images acquired by Raman microscopy with Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc.).

Github Repository: https://github.com/siettela/rhyme-igor

## **Procedure description**
- RHYME_MAIN.ipf (ver1.0.0): This procedure file provides a panel with various functions for analyzing 4D Raman imaging.
> Currently this procedure is closed due to some issues.

- RHYME_MVA.ipf (ver1.0.0): This procedure performs multivariate analysis (PCA, Clustering, 2D-COS, etc.) on Igor pro.This is an add-on, but it also works on its own. 
> Currently only PCA is implemented. There are several features under development and some comments are noted.

- RHYME_MCR.ipf (ver1.0.0): This procedure performs Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) on Igor pro.This is an add-on, but it also works on its own. 



## **Operation confirmation**
These procedure files have been confirmed to work with Igor pro 9.01 in macOS Monterey 12.1.

## **CAUTION**
These procedure files are under development and some bugs may exist.
